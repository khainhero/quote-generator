Hello world!,

I created this app using Create-React-App.

For this particular app, I used BootStrap, JQuery and reactjs. 

I utilized an API with the fetch() command. 

The API is from: 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json'

I then applied a Math.random() and output the Quote and Author for my application. This API has quotes in an Array with multiple objects each containing a quote and its author.

Thank you,
